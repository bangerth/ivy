# Text Editors and Development Environments

In this short lesson
we'll learn about *text editors* and *development environments*,
programs that help you write code.

*Learning objectives:*

* Understand the difference between a text editor and a word processor
* Know when to use a text editor
* See common traits of text editors
* Understand what a development environment is

## Rich text, plain text

What is plain text and what is rich text?
Broadly:

* *Plain text* is made from the characters you see on your keyboard.
Plain text is stored in a text file.
Code is plain text.

* *Rich text* is formed from plain text,
but includes additional metadata
like fonts, styles, colors, and other formatting.
Rich text may include embedded images and videos.
Rich text is typically stored in a binary, often proprietary, file format.
A Microsoft Word doc is rich text.

*Text editors* are designed to work with plain text.
*Word processors* are designed to work with rich text.
It's difficult (but not impossible)
to create one type of text with the tool designed for the other,
but just as a screwdriver can sometimes be used as a hammer,
it's not necessarily the best idea.

## Text editors

Text editors help you write code.
They offer features such as
* syntax highlighting
* command completion
* automatic indentation
* parenthesis and bracket matching

Every text editor has advantages and disadvantages.
It's best to find one you like and learn how to use it well.


Consider these rough categories of applications.

Text editors that are typically installed on a UNIX-based operating system:

* nano
* vi/m
* emacs

A sampling of other prominent text editors:

* VS Code
* Sublime Text
* Atom
* TextMate (macOS)
* Notepad++ (Windows)

## Development environments

Integrated development environments (IDEs) for Python (again, a sampling):
* Spyder
* PyCharm
* Eclipse

The distinction between a text editor and an IDE is heavily blurred.
Typically, we can consider an IDE to contain a text editor
as one of its components.

## Summary

Code is text.
Write code with a text editor.
It doesn't really matter which text editor you use--find one you like
and learn how to use it well.
Don't write code with a word processor.

### Note

We don't use text editors much in Ivy
because most of the course material is in Jupyter Notebook.
However,
when you write code for school or work,
you will undoubtedly use a text editor (or a development environment).
